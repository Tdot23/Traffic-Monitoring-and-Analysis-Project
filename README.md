# Project Overview
## Objective
### The main goal in this project is to set up a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for a small company's network. This system will efficiently gather and securely store logs from various sources, providing various dashboards for thorough analysis. Additionally, implement an Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to detect and respond to simulated attacks on the network. The IDS/IPS will send logs to the SIEM for dashboarding. We have chosen Splunk for our SIEM and Snort for our IDS.
